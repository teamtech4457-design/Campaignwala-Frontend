# Manual Test Plan for userDashboard pages index

## Objective
To ensure that the `index.jsx` file in `src/userDashboard/pages` correctly exports all the necessary components.

## Test Cases

### 1. Verify Exports
-   **Steps:**
    1.  In a test component or another part of the application, import `UserDashboardLayout` from `src/userDashboard/pages`.
    ```javascript
    import { UserDashboardLayout } from './path/to/src/userDashboard/pages';
    ```
    2.  Try to use the imported component.
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   The `UserDashboardLayout` component should be imported successfully without any errors.
    -   The application should compile and run without any issues related to this import.
