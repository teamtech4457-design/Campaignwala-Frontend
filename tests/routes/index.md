# Manual Test Plan for routes index

## Objective
To ensure that the `index.js` file in `src/routes` correctly exports all the necessary routing components and layouts.

## Test Cases

### 1. Verify Exports
-   **Steps:**
    1.  In a test component or another part of the application, import one or more of the exported components from `src/routes`.
    ```javascript
    import { ProtectedRoute, AppRouter } from './path/to/src/routes';
    ```
    2.  Try to use the imported components in your application code (e.g., in a router setup).
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   All components should be imported successfully without any errors.
    -   The application should compile and run without any issues related to these imports.
