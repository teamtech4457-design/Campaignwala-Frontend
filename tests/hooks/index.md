# Manual Test Plan for hooks index

## Objective
To ensure that the `index.js` file in `src/hooks` correctly exports all the necessary custom hooks.

## Test Cases

### 1. Verify Exports
-   **Steps:**
    1.  In a test component or another part of the application, import one or more of the exported hooks from `src/hooks`.
    ```javascript
    import { useAuth, useNavigation } from './path/to/src/hooks';
    ```
    2.  Try to use the imported hooks in your component.
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   All hooks should be imported successfully without any errors.
    -   The application should compile and run without any issues related to these imports.
