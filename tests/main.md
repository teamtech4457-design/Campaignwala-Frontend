# Manual Test Plan for main.jsx

## Objective
To ensure that the application starts up correctly and renders the main component without any errors.

## Test Cases

### 1. Application Startup
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Install all the dependencies by running `npm install`.
    2.  Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
    3.  Open a web browser and navigate to the local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   The application should load without any errors in the browser console.
    -   The main page of the application (likely the login page or dashboard) should be displayed.

### 2. Root Element
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Open the `index.html` file in the root of the project.
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   There should be a `div` element with the `id` of `root`.
    ```html
    <div id="root"></div>
    ```

### 3. Provider and Router Setup
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Using browser developer tools (e.g., React DevTools), inspect the component hierarchy.
-   **Expected Result:**
    -   The `AppRouter` component should be wrapped within the `ThemeProvider` and `Provider` (from react-redux) components.
