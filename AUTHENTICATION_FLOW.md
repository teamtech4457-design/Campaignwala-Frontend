### Registration Flow:

**User Registration:**

3. **Admin:** Only through predefined credentials (admin@test.com/admin123)
4. **User:** Can login with user@test.com/user123 OR register new account

### No OTP Required:
- Direct login without OTP verification
- Direct registration without OTP verification
- Credentials validated in authSlice
- Automatic redirection based on user role
